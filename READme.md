# Embed_ML_Model_Web_App üöÄ

This project is centered around integrating a Machine Learning model into a web application using FastAPI, complete with Dockerization and deployment on Hugging Face. The core objective is to create a predictive model for assessing sepsis risk in ICU patients, thereby augmenting the abilities of healthcare professionals via an easily accessible online platform.

## üìñ Overview

This project aims to:

- Embed a Machine Learning model into a user-friendly web application.
- Integrate advanced ML algorithms and models for interactive use.
- Dockerize the application for easy deployment.
- Deploy the app on Hugging Face for accessibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Containerization platform for packaging applications.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/): An AI research organization providing models and resources.
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-311/): The programming language used for development.

## üö¶ Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/petermutwiri/Sepsis_API

# Change directory
cd Embed_ML_Model_Web_App

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the FastAPI application
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## üöÄ Usage

Here's how you can use the project:

1. Access the web application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
2. Interact with the ML model through the user-friendly interface with features like the patients : Plasma glucose level,Body mass index,Blood pressure levels etc

## üìÑ Documentation

For detailed documentation and API usage, visit [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) after running the app locally.

## üì¶ Dockerization

First create a Dockerfile, check documention : [Docker Official Documentation - Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

Dockerize the application with the following commands:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t app_name-app .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 80:80 app_name-app
```

## üåê Deployment

The APP was further deployed on huggingface. You can interact with the app via huggingface following the steps below.

### Usage Instructions

To access the sepsis prediction app, you will need to be signed in to Hugging Face:

1. If you don't have a Hugging Face account, you can sign up for free at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/signup).
2. After signing in, you can access the app using the following URL:
